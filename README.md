# Active learning

Let's imagine having a dataset with few labelled samples and **the labelling cost is high**. However, you still want to classify the entirety of the dataset while having good performance.  
This is what active learning is for.    
I am going to apply an active learning technique with several algorithm, starting bY svm.
